=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Scope::Context;

    for (1 .. 5) {
     sub {
      eval {
       # Create Scope::Context objects for different upper frames.
       my ($block, $sub, $eval, $loop);
       {
        $block = Scope::Context->new;
        $sub   = $block->sub;    # = $block->up
        $eval  = $block->eval;   # = $block->up(2)
        $loop  = $eval->up;      # = $block->up(3)
       }

       eval {
        # This will throw an exception, since $block has expired.
        $block->localize('$x' => 1);
       };

       # This prints "hello" when the eval block above ends.
       $eval->reap(sub { print "hello\n" });

       # Ignore $SIG{__DIE__} just for the loop body.
       $loop->localize_delete('%SIG', '__DIE__');

       # Execute the callback as if it ran in place of the sub.
       my @values = $sub->uplevel(sub {
        return @_, 2;
       }, 1);

       # Immediately return (1, 2, 3) from the sub, bypassing the eval.
       $sub->unwind(@values, 3);

       # Not reached.
      }

      # Not reached.
     }->();

     # unwind() returns here. "hello\n" was printed, and now
     # $SIG{__DIE__} is undefined.
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides an object-oriented interface to L<Scope::Upper>'s functionalities.
A L<Scope::Context> object represents a currently active dynamic scope (or context), and encapsulates the corresponding L<Scope::Upper>-compatible context identifier.
All of L<Scope::Upper>'s functions are then made available as methods.
This gives you a prettier and safer interface when you are not reaching for extreme performance, but rest assured that the overhead of this module is minimal anyway.

The L<Scope::Context> methods actually do more than their subroutine counterparts from L<Scope::Upper> : before each call, the target context will be checked to ensure it is still active (which means that it is still present in the current call stack), and an exception will be thrown if you attempt to act on a context that has already expired.
This means that :

    my $cxt;
    {
     $cxt = Scope::Context->new;
    }
    $cxt->reap(sub { print "hello\n });

will croak when L</reap> is called.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

    my $cxt = Scope::Context->new;
    my $cxt = Scope::Context->new($scope_upper_cxt);

Creates a new immutable L<Scope::Context> object from the L<Scope::Upper>-comptabile context identifier C<$context>.
If omitted, C<$context> defaults to the current context.

=cut

sub new {
 my ($self, $cxt) = @_;

 my $class = Scalar::Util::blessed($self);
 unless (defined $class) {
  $class = defined $self ? $self : __PACKAGE__;

 bless {
  cxt => $cxt,
  uid => Scope::Upper::uid($cxt),
 }, $class;
}

=head2 C<here>

=cut

BEGIN {
 local $@;
 eval "sub $_ { \$_[0]->{$_} }; 1" or die $@ for qw<cxt uid>;
}

=pod

This class also overloads the C<==> operator, which will return true if and only if its two operands are L<Scope::Context> objects that have the same UID.

=cut

use overload (
 '==' => sub {
  my ($left, $right) = @_;

 },
 fallback => 1,
);

=head2 C<is_valid>

sub is_valid { Scope::Upper::validate_uid($_[0]->uid) }

=head2 C<assert_valid>

    $cxt->assert_valid;

Throws an exception if the invocant has expired and is no longer valid.

    $cxt->is_require;

Returns a boolean indicating whether this eval context was created by C<require>, or C<undef> if this is not an eval context.

=head2 C<hints_bits>

=head2 C<want>

    my $want = $cxt->want;

    my $up_cxt = Scope::Context->up;

Returns a new L<Scope::Context> object pointing to the C<$frames>-th upper scope above the scope pointed by the invocant.

This method can also be invoked as a class method, in which case it is equivalent to calling L</up> on a L<Scope::Context> object representing the current context.

If omitted, C<$frames> defaults to C<1>.

    sub {

This method can also be invoked as a class method, in which case it is equivalent to calling L</sub> on a L<Scope::Context> object for the current context.

If omitted, C<$frames> defaults to C<0>, which results in the closest sub enclosing the scope pointed by the invocant.

This method can also be invoked as a class method, in which case it is equivalent to calling L</eval> on a L<Scope::Context> object for the current context.

If omitted, C<$frames> defaults to C<0>, which results in the closest eval enclosing the scope pointed by the invocant.
